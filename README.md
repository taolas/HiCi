# HiCi African Food-Excel Dashboard and Pivot Table
# Project Overview

This project focuses on analysing and visualizing data related to HiCi African Foods expansion into the European Union market. The goal is to identify potential risks and provide insghts for overcoming regulatory hurdles using an Excel dashboard and pivot tables.
# Data Cleaning 

Prior to analysis, the raw data from the EU Food safety Standard Agency portal was subjected to a data ckeaning process to ensure accuracy and reliability. This included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing inconsistent data points.

# Excel Dashboard

An Excel dashboard was created to present key findings and visualizations from the data analysis. The dashboard includes interactive charts, tables and comprehensive view of the data.

# Pivot Tables

Pivot tables were utilized to aggregates and summarize the data, enabling easy exploration and identification of trends. The pivot tables allow for dynamic grouping, filtering and calculation of metrics, providing valuable insights into the food rejection patterns and associated factors. 

Findings and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following key determinants were identified:
  * The EU member country with the higest number of food rejections.
  * The most rejected food products.
  * The country of origin for the most rejected food products.
  * The most common action taken against food exported to the EU.
  * The most reported origin (Country) of food exports.
Additionally, risks associated with different food products were evaluated. Recommendation for HiCi African foods management were provided based on the identified risks, emphasizing the need to focus on specific food products to mitigate potential regulatory hurdles.

# Getting Started

To reproduce the analysis and view the Excel dashboard:

  1. Obtain the raw data from the EU Food safety Standard Agency Portal.
  2. Perform data cleaning using the appropriate software or tools (e.g, Excel, Python, R, etc)
  3. Create the Excel dashboard by importing the cleaned data and setting up interactive visualizations and pivot tables.
  4. Adjust the dashboard as needed to reflect the latest data or update the data source accordingly.
  5. Explore the dashboard to gain insights into the determinants and risks associated with food exports to the EU market.

# Dependencies

The project requires the following dependences:

  * Software or tools for data cleaning (e.g Excel, Python, R, etc)
  * Microsoft Excel for creating the dashboard and pivot tables.
